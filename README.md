# TODO App

I developed a TODO App using React.js and Context API, designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. The app allows users to add, delete, and update tasks with ease. A key feature of this app is its use of local storage to persist tasks, ensuring they remain intact even after a page refresh.

## Key Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to your list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Update Tasks**: Edit existing tasks to keep your list up to date.
- **Toggle Completion**: Check off tasks as completed with a toggle checkbox.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they don't disappear after refreshing the page.
- **State Management**: Utilizes React's Context API for efficient and scalable state management.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**
- **Local Storage**
- **Tailwind CSS**
